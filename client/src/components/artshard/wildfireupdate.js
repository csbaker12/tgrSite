        <h3>North America Wildfire Update</h3>
        <p>
          As of September 14, 2021, the National Interagency Fire Center (NIFC)
          reported that 44,647 wildfires in the United States had burned 5.6
          million acres of land. Similarly, the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire
          Centre (CIFFC) announced that 6,317 wildfires burned 10.34 million
          acres. Initially, the NIFC declared that the United States and Canada
          had a preparedness level of 5, meaning it had the potential to exhaust
          national firefighting resources. Due to the earliness and severity of
          the wildfire season, the United States and Canada were unable to
          provide each other with aid as in previous years. However, by
          September 20, 2021, the national preparedness level was reduced to 4
          and 1 for the United States and Canada, respectively.

          Experts say that climate change catalyzed the early wildfire season by
          exacerbating environmental conditions during the dry season.
          Furthermore, the North American wildfire season was predicted to be
          severe due to record drought conditions and high spring temperatures
          in the West. More than 75% of the western United States experienced
          drought conditions, with 21% of these conditions being deemed as
          "exceptional drought," the most extreme level of drought. These
          extreme conditions result in a lack of moisture on the ground that is
          imperative for combating wildfires. There were 311 early wildfires in
          the first four months of the year in Arizona, compared to 127 in the
          same period in 2020.
