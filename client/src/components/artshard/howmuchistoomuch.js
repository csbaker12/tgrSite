        <h3>How Much is Too Much???</h3>
        <p>
          From the bottom of my heart I genuinely sincerely hope nobody has
          clicked on this link. While there is absolutely nothing wrong with not
          having a massive assortment of gear, and it is certainly true that
          outdoor recreation can be fully rewarding and enjoyable without the
          latest and greatest in tech it must also be said that for those of us
          that spend every possible penny on gear there is no reason to be
          ashamed. Sure those new BDogs won't magically make you stomp a 720 but
          the feeling of clicking in to a new pair of skis for the first time is
          worth every penny. Plus who knows, maybe upgrading your fly rod is
          actually the issue and its not that your impatient and uncoordinated
          ;)
