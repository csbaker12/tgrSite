        <h3>Intro</h3>
        <p>
          Colorado has so many places that mountain bikers enjoy riding and
          absolutely love. From the western slope to the front range, you’ll
          find mountain bike trails that’ll stun you with their expansive views
          and intoxicating nature. Here are just a sliver of the magnificent
          mountain biking around Colorado’s Rockies.

        <h5>The Colorado Trail</h5>
        <p>
          This multi-use trail is very famous with hikers and use by bikers too.
          Its total length is nearly 500 miles of challenging alpine terrain
          from start to finish. For you to do the whole Colorado Trail you need
          to be physically fit to be able to endure the length. Commitment is
          also paramount for such fêtes to be accomplished, if you decide to do
          it, push through and make it to the end. For those looking for just a
          slice of Colorado’s most iconic trail, the Silverton to Durango track
          has a stunning single track with epic mountain views and no wilderness
          bypasses. It carries some serious vertical climbs though, as it
          summits more than one mountain pass. A more accessible area is located
          in Littleton’s Waterton Canyon.
        </p>

        <h5>Doctor Park, Crested Butte</h5>
        <p>
          This is another top trail in Colorado that has an amazing view on lock
          down. Doctor Park is 14.2 miles long with light traffic along the
          trails. It offers some long distance scenery and begins with a 2,500
          vertical-foot fire road ascend and turns to a middle ring double track
          to the trails high point of 10,877 feet. From the start outside
          Crested Butte, this trail will have knar, roots and a lot of corners
          in store for you, so be alert and ready for anything that might come
          your way. At the end, the trail suddenly tips upwards and you have to
          go down the hill. This is the most technical part of the ride but once
          you have successfully navigated to the bottom, you can enjoy a swim in
          Taylor River to cool off.
        </p>

        <h5>Monarch Crest, Salida</h5>
        <p>
          This is a single track bike trail with splendid scenery of valleys and
          mountains. Riding it can be quite extreme and take a toll on the body
          so you need to be well prepared with water and snacks. Situated
          outside Salida to the west of town, the beginning of the trail is
          quite flat when you start your ride in Monarch Crest. The way is quite
          smooth with no big rocks to maneuver. After a quick ascend on a double
          track, you should remain in the single track. Here you find some rocks
          and roots that you have to ride through.
