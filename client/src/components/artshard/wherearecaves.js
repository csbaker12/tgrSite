        <h3>Carlsbad Caverns National Park</h3>
        <p>
          Carlsbad Caverns National Park showcases more than 119 caves
          throughout a 46,000-acre region of southern New Mexico’s Chihuahuan
          Desert and Guadalupe Mountains, located approximately 18 miles from
          the city of Carlsbad. The park’s main attraction is its namesake show
          cave, Carlsbad Cavern, which is accessible via self-guided and
          ranger-led tours throughout the year and showcases attractions such as
          the 4,000-foot-long Big Room limestone chamber, the fifth largest of
          its kind in North America. Visitors may access the cavern via its
          natural entrance or using an elevator departing from the park’s
          visitor center, which also offers educational exhibits and documentary
          showings. The park is also known for its bat flight viewing program,
          hiking trails, and Rattlesnake Springs Picnic Area, which has been
          designated as an Important Bird Area by the National Audubon Society.

        <h3>Wind Cave National Park</h3>
        <p>
          Wind Cave National Park is located near the city of Hot Springs, South
          Dakota and was the first cave in the world to be preserved as part of
          a national park at its establishment in 1903. The cave was believed to
          have been historically referenced in Lakota Sioux folklore and was
          originally discovered by Europeans in 1881, taking its name from the
          cave’s continual atmospheric pressure breathing. Today, it is
          recognized as the world’s densest cave system, featuring more than 140
          miles of charted passageways showcasing sights such as its Post Office
          and Elks Room formations. Above ground, the park is home to the United
          States’ largest preserved mixed-grass prairie region, containing a
          variety of trails offering views of the nearby Black Hills.

        <h3>Antelope Canyon</h3>
        <p>
          Antelope Canyon is a slot canyon near Lake Powell, located on Navajo
          Nation reservation land near the city of Page. The cave was formed as
          the result of Navajo sandstone erosion due to flash flooding and still
          experiences a significant amount of flooding today, including a 2006
          flood that closed the cave to the public for five months. It is
          divided into two sections, officially known as Upper and Lower
          Antelope Canyon, which are commonly referred to as “The Crack” and
          “The Corkscrew.” The cave portions have been open to the public
          exclusively through guided tours since 1997 and have become a popular
          spot for photography despite their lighting and foot access path
          limitations. Upper Antelope Canyon is a particularly popular spot due
          to its easy access at ground level, requiring no climbing in or out of
          the cave.
