        <h3>Yellowstone National Park</h3>
        <p>
          With dramatic peaks and pristine lakes, Yellowstone National Park is
          an outdoor enthusiast's paradise. Multicolored pools swirl around hot
          springs; verdant forests weave past expansive meadows; and volatile
          geysers launch streams of steaming water toward the sky. With so much
          unspoiled natural beauty, it's no wonder why everyone suspected John
          Colter (a scout for explorers Lewis and Clark) was embellishing when
          he first described Yellowstone's geothermal curiosities in 1807.
          Nowadays, there's no doubt that the park is indeed extraordinary.
          While you traverse its 3,000-plus square miles of mountains, canyons,
          geysers and waterfalls, be prepared to share the trails with permanent
          residents like buffalo, elk and sometimes even grizzlies.{' '}
        </p>
        <p>
          Although Yellowstone attracts more than 4 million visitors every year,
          chances are – unless you spend your entire trip at Old Faithful – you
          won't see much of them. Yellowstone's 2.2 million acres creep from the
          northwest corner of Wyoming into the edges of Idaho and Montana,
          offering plenty of untouched territory to explore. Carve out a day or
          two to take in the view at Yellowstone Lake and Mammoth Hot Springs.
          But save some time for the trails through lesser-known regions, like
          the hot springs of the West Thumb Geyser Basin and the untamed
          wildlife dotting the Lewis River Channel and Dogshead Loop. While the
          sheer number of trails and wildlife-watching opportunities may seem
          daunting at first, remember: You can always come back.

        <h3>The Grand Canyon</h3>
        <p>
          Grand" doesn't begin to do this canyon justice. Measuring
          approximately 277 river miles in length, up to 18 miles in width and a
          mile deep, this massive chasm in northern Arizona is truly a natural
          wonder. For 6 million years, the Grand Canyon has expanded with the
          help of the mighty Colorado River, and for centuries, people from all
          over the globe have traveled to gaze out over its red and orange
          grandeur. Managed by the National Park Service and officially
          designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, the Grand Canyon leaves
          its approximately 6 million visitors per year awestruck.
        </p>
        <p>
          But if you're seeking a secluded escape to Mother Nature, you should
          be prepared: The Grand Canyon can be very crowded. The South Rim –
          home to the Grand Canyon Village and the well-worn Bright Angel Trail
          – is particularly popular for sightseers and hikers. It is on this
          side that you'll find the most amenities. For a break from the crowds,
          head to the North Rim. This is the place for backwoods camping and
          hardcore hiking. And for an unforgettable view of the canyon, consider
          signing up for a helicopter tour.

        <h3>Jackson, Wyoming</h3>
        <p>
          Sandwiched between Grand Teton National Park to the north and miles of
          national forest in every other direction, the Jackson Hole valley has
          remained relatively isolated from the burgeoning travel industry.
          Instead it has survived on local industries like logging, ranching
          and, during the 19th century, fur trading. But recently, Jackson Hole
          has encouraged the rise of tourism. Former blue-collar settlements
          like Jackson and Grand Teton now boast notable art and performance
          venues, and mega ski resorts have transformed the region into an
          up-and-coming winter wonderland. When planning an opulent getaway,
          many people don't give western Wyoming a thought. To those travelers,
          we say: Think again.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sure, you won't encounter the glitz and glam of Aspen or Lake Tahoe,
          but the beauty and vastness of the Jackson Hole region has caught the
          attention of Hollywood celebs like Harrison Ford and politicos like
          former Vice President Dick Cheney. Yet, even with its fresh and
          luxurious upgrade, Jackson Hole remains first and foremost the heart
          of mountain country, with rugged trails and miles of open space that
          recall a time before the West was won.
