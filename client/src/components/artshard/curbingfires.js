        <h3>What Can We Do To Mitigate Forest Fires?</h3>
        <p>
          If you’re wondering why California fires are getting worse, the answer
          might come as a surprise: although science shows that climate change
          is driving the increasing severity, over 90% of forest fires in the
          United States are caused by humans and many of them can be prevented.
          While we’ve all heard about the gender reveal party that sparked the
          deadly El Dorado fire, many of our everyday activities can also ignite
          them. We may not be able to stop California forest fires entirely
          because California has a unique fire ecology, but if you reside in a
          state that is prone to drought or forest fires, it's imperative to
          follow forest safety guidelines and prevent potential disasters.
          Despite these challenges, California's landscape history goes back
          countless generations and is worth exploring to better understand how
          we got here.

        <h5>Dont Set Off Pyrotechnics</h5>
        <p>
          We get it: fireworks are as American as baseball and apple pie, and
          they sure are fun to set off. And gender reveal smoke bombs are all
          the rage these days, but in a hot and dry environment, they just
          aren’t worth the risk.

        <h5>Carefully Dispose of Smoking Materials</h5>
        <p>
          Be it a joint or a cigarette, douse your butts with water and place in
          a fire-proof container to safely dispose of when you’re sure they’ve
          gone out. And whatever you do, don’t toss them on the ground.

        <h5>Camp Responsibly</h5>
        <p>
          Make sure the conditions are safe and that there isn’t a fire ban
          where you are — and never leave your campfire unattended. When you’re
          done, douse it and wait until it’s completely cold to the touch before
          leaving your campsite.
