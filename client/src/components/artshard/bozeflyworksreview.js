        <h3>Fly Rod Package - Patriot Fly Reel ($270)</h3>
        <p>
          The 9' 5 weight package with Patriot reel is a great introductory rod
          for someone that wants a reliable rod that is easy on the pockets. A
          fully sealed drag offers great durability and a 4 piece rod design
          makes travel and storage a breeze. A medium fast action lets users
          cast out a ways without being overwhelmed. Blue fly line and backing
          are aesthetically pleasing and easy to track in the water. I tested
          this set up for the past year and have greatly enjoyed it. This is not
          meant to be the greatest rod ever but it does get the job done and is
          very versatile.
