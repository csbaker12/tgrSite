        <h3>Intro</h3>
        <p>
          We are fortunate as anglers in Montana to be surrounded by some of the
          best fly fishing rivers in the world. From the famous tailwaters
          boasting trophy fish and some of the highest fish per mile counts in
          the country to our many freestone rivers filled with wild trout,
          Montana truly is the last best place for a fly fishing trip. As a
          professional outfitter, our Montana fly fishing guides are lucky to be
          able to spend so much time fly fishing and introducing anglers to our
          many great rivers. Every river in our state has something to offer
          anglers on a Montana fly fishing trip and we feel strongly that our
          top 5 Montana fly fishing rivers should only be a starting point for
          anglers fly fishing in the Big Sky State. Nevertheless, we have put in
          the time on the water, explored all over the Big Sky State and are
          here to report on our top 5 rivers to fly fish in Montana.

        <h5>The Yellowstone</h5>
        <p>
          The Yellowstone River has always had a special place in our hearts and
          we without a doubt consider it the best river to fly fish in Montana.
          From its origins in Yellowstone National Park to its end just across
          our state line, the Yellowstone River is the longest undammed river in
          our country, running wild and free. We consider the length of the
          Yellowstone River from Gardiner, MT to Columbus, MT to be the blue
          ribbon stretch in Montana, and are lucky to be able to consider the
          Yellowstone River one of our home waters in Bozeman, MT. Great
          populations of native Yellowstone cutthroat trout populate the river
          upstream of Livingston, MT as well as wild rainbow and brown trout
          along its entire length. Fly Fishing on the Yellowstone River is
          freestone fishing at its finest. Great hatches of stoneflies,
          caddisflies, and mayflies as well as the annual hopper bite make for
          some of the best dry fly fishing anywhere in Montana. Anglers can fish
          dry flies from July through October every day and expect to do well.
          Some of the largest brown trout caught every year in Montana come out
          of the Yellowstone River, from the many deep holes and cutbanks found
          along every bend. If our fly fishing guides had to pick one river to
          fish in Montana for the rest of their lives, the answer is the
          Yellowstone River every time.

        <h5>The Missouri </h5>
        <p>
          The mighty Missouri River near Craig, MT is without a doubt the finest
          tailwater fishery in Montana. 5000+ trout per mile, wild trout
          averaging 17-19 inches, and consistent hatches anglers have to see to
          believe. The Missouri River is also a true year-round fishery, one of
          the few in the Big Sky State. Our fly fishing guides consider the fly
          fishing in April, May, June, late September, and October to be the
          most productive in Montana. Anglers can count on great hatches of
          mayflies and caddisflies to keep the Missouri River trout looking up,
          often eagerly consuming dry flies in large pods of more than 20 fish
          at a time. There is no where else in the state of Montana an angler
          fishing two dry flies could possibly catch two 20+ inch trout on one
          cast. We’ve seen it happen on the Missouri River. A few times. The
          Missouri River is also one of our most versatile and dynamic fisheries
          offering great nymphing and streamer fishing throughout the season. No
          Montana fly fishing trip is complete without a day spent on the mighty
          ‘Mo.

        <h5>The Madison</h5>
        <p>
          The Madison River is likely one of the most well-known, published, and
          revered rivers in Montana and rightfully deserves a spot near the top
          of our list. Ennis, MT is one of Montana’s great trout towns, right on
          the banks of the Madison River. Fly fishing on the Madison River is
          nothing short of a right of passage amongst Montana anglers. Success
          on the Madison River comes with time spent learning the intricacies
          and the rhythms of this river. The waters of the Madison River are
          swift, dynamic, and absolutely loaded with healthy populations of wild
          brown and rainbow trout, but often hard to crack for first time
          anglers unfamiliar with the unique character of the fifty-mile riffle.
          Anglers find the struggle worth it, as they will be rewarded with
          great fly fishing for some of the largest average size trout in
          Montana. Trophy rainbow trout and brown trout can be found on every
          bend and are often willing to rise to dry flies throughout the season.
          The annual salmonfly hatch is the stuff of fly fishing legends and
          anglers make the pilgrimage from all over the world to test their
          skill against the Madison River.

        <h5>The Blackfoot</h5>
        <p>
          The Blackfoot River is known to many anglers as the river that runs
          through it, as it was the subject of Norman MacLean’s famous ode to
          fly fishing in Montana. The Blackfoot River is so much more than just
          a back drop for a book and movie to anglers and our guides. The
          Blackfoot River is arguably the perfect freestone trout stream.
          Gin-clear waters, native Westslope Cutthroat Trout, and great hatches
          make the Blackfoot River a favorite amongst all anglers fly fishing in
          Montana. The scenery alone makes a day spent fly fishing on the
          Blackfoot River worth the trip. The great fishing is often just an
          added bonus. From the upper reaches of the Blackfoot River down to its
          confluence with the Clark Fork River, anglers can find great fly
          fishing along the entire length. While Hollywood may have introduced
          the Blackfoot River to the world, it is still a top river in Montana
          for anglers.

        <h5>The Bighorn</h5>
        <p>
          Montana’s Bighorn River is a trout fly fishing fantasy land. With fish
          per mile numbers higher than good reason could believe and hatches of
          epic proportions, fly fishing on the Bighorn River is something
          anglers really do need to see to believe. In recent years, fish
          populations have taken a hit due to environmental factors, but the
          Bighorn River should still be considered a worthwhile destination for
          any Montana fly fishing trip. The wild rainbow and brown trout are as
          hearty as they come, and we have no doubt they will continue to swim
          in the world class waters of the Bighorn River for generations to
          come.
