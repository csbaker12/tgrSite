        <h3>Intro</h3>
        <p>
          Oregon has beaches and waves for all kinds of surfers. Whether you
          have never stepped on a surfboard before, or can hit the waves with
          your eyes closed, there are surfing locations for you. Longboarders,
          shortboarders, beginners, and old-timers, Oregon beaches have you
          covered. Once you hit your first wave here, surrounded by the stunning
          scenery, you wonâ€™t ever want to head back onto dry land. If you are
          new to surfing, there are plenty of places to surf in Oregon that have
          surf schools up and down the coast, with experienced surf instructors
          ready to show you the ropes and turn you into a surfing pro. With a
          coast of over 350 miles, there are some amazing surf breaks for
          everyone, set against the impressive backdrop of sea cliffs and sand
          dunes.

        <h5>Indian Beach</h5>
        <p>
          Indian beach is located in Ecola State Park and is perfect for
          beginners to go surfing in Oregon. The beach itself is sheltered from
          the prevailing winds, with the breaks mostly coming from the right.
          There is some incredible scenery here to accompany the great waves,
          with the huge basalt rock of Tillamook Headland towering above you
          when you hit the waves. The waters here are so popular, you should
          also be very aware of kayakers in the water, that are actually more of
          them than surfers at some points throughout the year. Summer tends to
          offer the best conditions, and surfing is best when the wind direction
          is from the east. Both groundswells and wind swells can be found here,
          with beach breaks both left and right.

        <h5>Cannon Beach</h5>
        <p>
          Cannon Beach, one of the most well-known beaches on the coast, and a
          great Oregon surf spot. Located close to both Portland and Salem, the
          beach is easily accessible and incredibly beautiful. When you hit the
          waves, you will be treated to impressive views of Haystack Rock
          jutting out of the water, and the sea birds that flock there
          throughout the year. If you want to avoid the crowds, early morning
          and evenings are best on wind-free days. The waves are pretty mellow
          here, which makes it a good spot for those that are not used to being
          on a surfboard. Because the waves break right on the beach, the best
          surfing is where the waves are small and breaking cleanly, but the
          close-in breaks offer good practice for beginners in the shallower
          waters. Cannon Beach Surf Lessons and Rentals offers quality surf
          lessons and rentals taught by professions. Whether you are a complete
          beginner or are just looking to hire a beach and wetsuit, the team
          here will have you covered. There are also several other surf shops
          such as Cannon Beach Surf and Cleanline Surf.

        <h5>Short Sand Beach</h5>
        <p>
          Short Sand Beach is a very popular surfing spot in Oregon, so chances
          are you will see people trying to catch a wave while visiting the
          area. It is especially popular with beginners as it is nicely
          protected from rough weather. Despite this, the waves are pretty
          consistent and can work at any time of the year. Be aware that because
          of its popularity, it can get very crowded during the summer,
          especially during weekends. It is not only a beautiful spot for
          surfing, but also hiking, as the area is surrounded by an old-growth
          forest of Sitka spruce. Our favorite is the Cape Falcon hike which
          runs right through Short Sand beach anyway! So maybe bring your board
          and hiking boots when heading over here for the day.
