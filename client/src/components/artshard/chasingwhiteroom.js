        <h3>The Secret Stash</h3>
        <p>
          Truth is I will never give my secret spots away unless I want to share
          them with you. We got absolutely pitted last winter, more over the
          head blower whiteroom pow turns than I can count. It was epic and I'm
          afraid if I dish out the secrets I won't see those days ever again.
        </p>
        <p>
          I will offer you this. Be spontaneous, be adventurous. Watch
          forecasts. If it's lining up to nuke somewhere, make it happen. Sure
          it's a pain in the ass getting there and getting situated sometimes
          but the turns you'll find in the process will be the memories that
          last
