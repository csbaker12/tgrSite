        <h3>Intro</h3>
        <p>
          Bouldering, the art of climbing small cliffs and blocks, celebrates
          the joy of vertical movement. It’s all about the challenge, of moving
          with simplicity and reducing climbing to its bare essentials—your
          hands and feet and the rock. Once fall comes to the United States,
          climbers head out on the highway to find adventure at America’s
          world-class bouldering areas, and dream of busting hard moves at
          iconic places like Bishop, Hueco Tanks, Joe’s Valley, and Horse Pens
          40. Gone are summer’s heat and humidity, replaced by dry air, better
          friction, and warm sunshine. Here are America’s best autumn bouldering
          experiences broken down by region.
        </p>

        <h5>Northeast</h5>
        <p>
          The northeastern states yield a slew of bouldering gems scattered
          across wooded valleys and mountains near major cities like Boston and
          New York City. Fall brings ideal weather plus colorful displays of
          changing leaves. The Shawangunks, aka The Gunks, near New Paltz is not
          only one of America’s premier trad climbing areas but it also offers
          stacks of boulder problems from VO to V14 on solid quartz conglomerate
          blocks. The Trapps area boasts more than 250 documented problems.
          Lincoln Woods State Park is an easily accessed bouldering paradise on
          the northern edge of Providence, Rhode Island. Most of the problems at
          the Woods are seconds away from the paved park road. First, hit the
          Warm-Up Cave, then head to Iron Cross Boulder and The Wave, a steep V2
          classic. Pawtuckaway State Park in southern New Hampshire is another
          magical New England bouldering area with hundreds of granite boulders
          hidden in shady valleys and alongside Round Pond. Pawtuckaway, dubbed
          P-way, is a destination area with hundreds of problems, including
          tricky slabs, crimpfests, power lines, and plenty of moderates.
        </p>

        <h5>Southeast </h5>
        <p>
          Over the last 30 years, boulderers have developed some of America’s
          best blocks in the deep southeastern woods. The bouldering areas are
          ideal in cool fall conditions with good friction and low humidity.
          West Virginia’s Coopers Rock State Forest is the state’s best
          bouldering venue, with hundreds of gritstone boulders lining the
          scenic rim of the Cheat River Gorge. The coarsely textured gritstone
          offers good friction on jugs, slopers, and rounded dishes. Start your
          Coopers’ tour at the popular Roadside Area and then head to Tilted
          Tree for plenty of toughies. The park also offers camping and more
          than 50 miles of trails. Bouldering in Alabama? Yep, Horse Pens 40, at
          a private park an hour’s drive north of Birmingham, is simply one of
          America’s great bouldering arenas. Expect smooth sandstone blocks
          eroded into strange shapes and bulbous sloper handholds. There are
          more than 400 established problems spread over 100 boulders. Alabama
          has perfect winter weather for bouldering, and Horse Pens has camping
          and a restaurant a mere five-minute walk from the boulders. Rocktown,
          45 minutes south of Chattanooga in northern Georgia, offers a field of
          sandstone boulders in a state wildlife area atop Pigeon Mountain. With
          bullet-proof sandstone, more than 500 problems, and bomber crimps and
          slopers, Rocktown spreads across the mountain and rarely feels
          crowded. Start at The Orb, then head into the forest for mega-classic
          problems. You’ll need a Georgia Outdoor Recreation Pass to go
          bouldering.

        <h5>Midwest</h5>
        <p>
          There’s plenty of rock for climbing in the Midwest from Missouri and
          southern Illinois to the north woods of Minnesota and Wisconsin.
          Devils Lake State Park in Wisconsin is not only the Midwest’s oldest
          and best climbing area, but it also offers plenty of bouldering on
          quartzite blocks. Since 2005 the area has seen an explosion of boulder
          problems, with more than 1,000 challenges of all grades. Most of the
          problems are at East and West bluffs. The Holy Boulders, the best
          bouldering area in Illinois, is an Access Fund success story.
          Discovered in 2004, the sandstone boulders, home to more than 350
          aesthetic problems, were on private property that the Access Fund
          bought and transferred to the Illinois Climber’s Association. Expect
          excellent friction moves and warm fall temperatures.

        <h5>Mountain West</h5>
        <p>
          The Rocky Mountain states are the mecca of American bouldering with
          hundreds of areas from alpine granite to desert sandstone. With so
          much rock to crimp, it’s hard to decide which are the best bouldering
          spots but here are three fantastic choices. The Dakota sandstone
          blocks above Horsetooth Reservoir in northern Colorado were the
          birthplace of modern American bouldering when the legendary John Gill
          established three problems on the Mental Block in 1967. The boulders,
          overlooking a glistening lake, offer hundreds of problems of all
          grades on immaculate stone. Start at the Plano Boulders before heading
          to Rotary Park and Ship’s Prow, Eliminate Boulder, and Penny Boulder.
          When snow falls in the high country, drive to Unaweep Canyon in
          western Colorado for solitude, stellar problems, and ideal bouldering
          temperatures. Unaweep, a 20-minute drive from Grand Junction, offers a
          maze of sandstone boulders strewn below cliff bands. It’s easy to find
          sun or shade on boulders at the Bone Park including Plethora Boulder
          with 13 problems and Fossil Block with the imprint of a dinosaur bone,
          The Rock Garden, and Grand Valley Boulders. Joe’s Valley, a remote
          canyon in central Utah, offers boulderers thousands of easy-to-expert
          problems on sandstone blocks decorated with black and tan streaks.
          Head to Joe’s for perfect fall temperatures with warm days and chilly
          nights and great bouldering on delicate slabs, crimpy faces, and
          overhanging power problems. Head to the Left Fork for classic
          established routes right off the road. The Right Fork is higher and
          cooler, while New Joe’s boasts the most problems. Drive down to
          Orangeville and Castle Dale for road-trip amenities and food.

        <h5>South West</h5>
        <p>
          The southwestern states are the ideal bouldering destination with
          piles of problems and iconic bouldering areas like Hueco Tanks. Expect
          great weather with warm days and low precipitation and, best of all,
          no snow. Hueco Tanks, a Texas state historical park, rises above the
          dusty desert east of El Paso. Hueco, one of the world’s best
          bouldering areas, is a compact park with several thousand problems
          scattered across four mountains. North Mountain, covered with classic
          boulders, requires a reservation for self-guided bouldering since
          daily use is limited to 70 climbers. The excellent blocks on East Spur
          and East and West mountains can only be visited with a certified
          guide. Besides being one of the best winter climbing areas in the
          country, Red Rock Canyon on the west side of Las Vegas is also a primo
          bouldering venue. The Kraft Boulders in Calico Basin offer plenty of
          Aztec sandstone boulders covered with handholds and lots of mellow
          problems for novices. Check out routes on The Cube, Potato Chip
          Boulder, and Pearl Boulder, and wedge up Plumber’s Crack, a photogenic
          chimney climb. Flagstaff, the gateway to the Grand Canyon, is a
          climber’s paradise with plenty of autumn bouldering in the piney woods
          surrounding the town. Priest Draw, a collection of textured limestone
          boulders nestled in a valley, is Flag’s go-to bouldering hot-spot with
          hundreds of problems from pocketed slabs to thuggish overhangs. Also,
          grab slopers and rails on Kelly Canyon’s sandstone blocks and short
          cliffs. Bring a short rope or crash pads for highballs.
        </p>

        <h5>West Coast</h5>
        <p>
          Like the Rockies, spectacular bouldering areas fill the West Coast
          from San Diego to Seattle. Follow the sun and warmth on a fall
          bouldering trip by keeping to the southern sites. The mountain town of
          Bishop, tucked against the towering Sierra Nevada, is another place
          that vies for the title of America’s best bouldering area. Surrounding
          the picturesque town are legendary boulders lined with thousands of
          classic problems of every style and grade. Start at the famed
          Buttermilks with highballs on fingertip-shredding blocks, then head to
          the Happy and Sad boulders at the Volcanic Tablelands. If you need a
          few pitches, rope up at nearby Owens River Gorge. Boulderers flock
          like snowbirds to Joshua Tree National Park in southern California to
          enjoy the park’s 358 rain-free days and a wonderland of granite
          boulders. With thousands of boulders, it’s hard to decide which
          rockpile to hit first. It’s best to start at Hidden Valley Campground
          with no approach and plenty of fun problems from V0 to V10. If your
          tips aren’t raw, check out other spots like Quail Springs, Indian
          Cove, and Real Hidden Valley. What’s a bouldering trip without
          visiting Yosemite Valley, the crucible of American climbing? The
          granite blocks in Camp 4, the famed climber’s campsite, boast
          signature problems up slick slabs, rounded aretes, and biting cracks.
          Don’t forget to try Midnight Lightning, America’s most famous boulder
          problem. Also, put your hands on boulders at Candyland, Cathedral
          Boulders, Knobby Wall, and, if the Tuolumne Road is still open, visit
          the Pywiak Boulders. Bouldering is one of the only times in life when
          it’s good to have more problems and judging by this list you can see
          there are plenty to be had in the States. From New Hampshire to
          California, the Lower 48 is awash with world-class bouldering areas
          just waiting for you to pack the crash pads, fill the chalk bag, and
          hit the road.
