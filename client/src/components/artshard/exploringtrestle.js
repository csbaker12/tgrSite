        <h3>About</h3>
        <p>
          Nestled in a small valley on the west side of the Continental Divide
          lies the town of Winter Park, home to Colorado’s most favored bike
          park. With over 2,000 feet of vertical rise, Trestle Bike Park
          contains the largest variety of lift-access mountain bike trails. The
          resort offers mountain bike enthusiasts forty miles of descending
          terrain via three lifts, accessing 63 trails in total. The trail
          variety at the bike park, hours of operation and being located nearest
          to Denver, makes this lift access bike park beloved by the Front Range
          locals and visitors alike.

          Arriving at the resort you will notice that there are plenty of
          parking lots; all lots are free-of-charge. The locals know that you
          will want to arrive early to secure a spot in the parking garage. The
          garage is nearest to the resort base and offers you, your vehicle, and
          any fur-babies you bring relief from Colorado’s unpredictable weather
          patterns. Keep in mind if adverse weather does occur, and lift service
          is paused for 70 consecutive minutes you can stop by the ticket office
          and receive a rain check for your lift pass and/or bike rental.
          Throughout the day, expect mountain bikers to be hanging out,
          snacking, and having a refreshing beverage in the garage between party
          laps! Sorry van-lifers, you cannot park in the garage. If you still
          want to join the party, tall vehicles can park on the roof of the
          garage or in other lots throughout the resort property. Self contained
          vehicles are permitted for overnight parking in the G Lot for a
          maximum of three (3) days. While you are waiting for the lifts to
          start running, head over to Goody’s Mountain Creperie where you can
          kickstart your day with a warm brew of coffee and indulge in a sweet
          or savory crêpe. Goody’s is known for its baked goods, but our go-to
          order is the breakfast burrito with the gravy on the side. This fairly
          priced breakfast burrito is large enough to sustain two hungry
          mountain bikers for hours.

          The Gondola at the resort base fits three people with bikes. A quick
          ride up Winter Park Mountain and you will not only find yourself at
          the start of most of the bike park’s trails, but you will be at 10,700
          feet in elevation surrounded by panoramic views of the continental
          divide and the rocky mountains. Take note of the Sunspot Lodge as it
          is perfect for a quick lunch stop serving everything from grab-n-go
          salads to nachos and CLIF Energy Bars. If mom and dad tag along for
          your mountain bike adventure, the Sunspot also offers a full bar with
          outdoor seating and family activities. Let it be known that this lodge
          has typical resort prices, and you can save yourself a few bucks by
          shopping at the convenience store at the resort base. The Trails End
          Mercantile offers groceries, souvenirs, gifts and is easily accessible
          as it’s located a few steps away from the Gondola.

          Many riders choose to explore Green World Trail as their first lap on
          the mountain. Green World is a flowy green trail that spans from the
          top of Winter Park Mountain to the base of the resort and offers
          access to all lifts serving the Trestle Bike Park. If Green World
          Trail is too mellow for you, Shy Ann is also accessible from the
          Sunspot Lodge. This blue trail is extremely fun, offering a variety of
          terrain originating as a speedy jump line and flows into sections of
          steep, technical terrain into Five Points. For the intermediate rider,
          Long Trail and Free Speech are continuations of Shy Ann from Five
          Points to the base of the mountain giving you a stepping stone into
          Trestle Bike Park’s black diamond trails.

          If you are an expert-level mountain biker with a need for speed,
          Rainmaker is a black diamond jump trail and is perfect to get warmed
          up on or host party trains with your friends. Rainmaker Trail provides
          a beltway to a majority of Trestle Bike Park trails. At different
          points, you will pass beneath the Olympia lift, descend into Five
          Points, and get dropped off at the Eskimo lift. On Rainmaker, you will
          continue to flow down the mountain to the intersection of multiple
          trails known as Five Points. Five Points serves as a meet-up point for
          friends and provides a spot for a quick bike tune, water, or access to
          emergency services. Rainmaker has jumps ranging from 5-20’ in length
          (give or take a few feet) and it will lead you directly to the Eskimo
          Express, Trestle’s third trail serving lift. Here’s where you make the
          hardest decision: continue on Jury Duty to Boot Camp and ultimately to
          the base or hop on the Eskimo lift which takes you back up to the Sun
          Spot Lodge?
