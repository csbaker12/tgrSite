        <h3>The Madison River, MT</h3>
        <p>
          The Madison River in Montana is one of the best fly fishing rivers in
          the entire world. Anglers from the area often refer to it as the 50
          Mile Riffle. There are wonderful hatches, large fish and ample water
          to explore. The portions below Quake Lake as well as Hebgen Lake are
          always guaranteed to be filled with fish. Another great place to
          access the Madison is within Bear Trap Canyon. It’s a difficult
          portion of the river to access, but it’s less pressured so you’ll have
          more success in landing some of those trophy rainbow and brown trout.
          Pay attention to the caddis and spinner hatches in the evenings!
          They’re unreal.

        <h3>North Platte River, WY</h3>
        <p>
          The North Platte River is extremely well known and heavily fished in
          Colorado, but the Wyoming portion is relatively untouched and a great
          spot to fish. The Grey Reef portion of the river is one of the best
          rainbow trout fisheries in all of the United States. There are roughly
          8,000 fish per mile, but quite a bit of it is privately owned. With
          all the private land on the North Platte, check out the section
          managed for fishing by the Bureau of Land Management.{' '}
        </p>
        <p>
          Many compare this fishery to the San Juan and Bighorn rivers. You
          don’t have to travel far to hook into a double digit rainbow. Be sure
          that you’re well equipped with Clouser Minnows, Wooly Buggers as well
          as a variety of dries. BWO’s, Spinners and Tricos are all going to
          work well. Be prepared to fish riffles, pocket water as well as some
          nice pools.

        <h3>Yampa River, CO</h3>
        <p>
          The Yampa River offers a true western fly fishing experience. You’ll
          be spending your time in the midst of beautiful forests, clear water
          and trophy fish. You’re able to fish this river throughout the town of
          Yampa as well as Steamboat Springs. It’s one of the more accessible
          rivers in Colorado.{' '}
        </p>
        <p>
          This river will flow nicely throughout the year so the season never
          has to end! There are nice populations of rainbow and brown trout
          throughout the waters. Be sure you pack Trico, midge as well as Golden
          Stone flies. These are the main hatches and life is quite exciting on
          the Yampa when insects are hatching!
