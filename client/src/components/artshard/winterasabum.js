        <h3>Making Money</h3>
        <p>
          Obviously the trickiest part of being a ski bum is balancing skiing
          every single day with making enough money to afford ramen and your
          100sq foot bedroom. This particular bum tried a myriad of jobs and I
          am here to tell you the greatest truth of all ski bum level jobs. Most
          of them suck. Especially the ones that allow you to ski seven days a
          week. Realistically you should just maximize your wage. The more you
          earn per hour the less you have to work.

        <h3>Skiing</h3>
        <p>
          My biggest piece of advice here is don't ski bell to bell every day.
          You aren't a weekend warrior anymore and skiing first chair to last
          lap every single day will aboslutely obliterate your body. Find a
          groove, ski your favorite stuff, seek the good snow, and just enjoy
          it. No need to overdo it.
