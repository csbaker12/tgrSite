        <h3>Intro</h3>
        <p>
          The American Southwest is a playground for hikers, photographers, and
          adventurers. Fun to explore and extremely photogenic, slot canyons
          provide a unique hiking experience. We have assembled a short list of
          some of the best slot canyons in Utah, Arizona, and Nevada. This is
          not an all-inclusive list, because there are tons of slot canyons in
          this area, but listed below are some of the most popular and the most
          scenic slot canyons to explore.From short, easy, scenic walks to all
          day technical hikes, take your pick of the slot canyons you want to
          explore.

        <h5>Antelope Canyon</h5>
        <p>
          Arguably the most beautiful slot canyon on this list, this is also the
          most popular. Located on Navajo lands, this slot canyon can only be
          visited on a tour. Two different slot canyons make up Antelope Canyon
          and both offer very different experiences. When people refer to
          Antelope Canyon, they are usually referring to Upper Antelope Canyon.
          With its light beams, falling sands, and high canyon walls, this is
          the more photogenic of the two canyons. Lower Antelope Canyon is
          narrower at the bottom. With these narrow passageways and ladders to
          climb, this canyon is more fun to visit.

        <h5>Buckskin Gulch</h5>
        <p>
          Buckskin Gulch is labeled as the longest slot canyon in the world, 21
          miles one way. It is dark and narrow with just enough obstacles to
          keep things interesting. It is possible to do this as one long day
          hike, going point to point, although some hikers do this in two days,
          camping overnight along the trail. A permit is necessary, even if you
          do it as a day hike.

        <h5>Zebra</h5>
        <p>
          With pink and red striped walls, this slot canyon is uniquely
          beautiful. Parts of the slot canyon can be challenging to hike through
          but your reward is seeing these extraordinary striped canyon walls.
