        <h3>Do you like Skiing with Friends?</h3>
        <p>
          The idea of a day on the hill with your best buds is admittedly
          something we all look forward to. Whether its sharing a few beers or
          chasing each other down the mountain, I have so many great memories of
          skiing with my friends. Truthfully they are a huge component of why I
          fell in love with skiing.
        </p>
        <p>
          That being said I am here to offer a word of warning. In many ways,
          nobody wants to see you fail worse than your friends. As I look back
          on my career I think who was it pointing the camera and cheering every
          time I did something stupid? One of my friends. With that I beg you
          the question: can they be trusted?

          As depicted in the above image, I was skiing with my roommates on a
          nice cloudy Bridger day. As I finish my run I notice one of my buddies
          pointing the camera my way. As any priveliged sheltered Colorado kid
          would do, I throw my hands up and give my best thug look. Then I
          realize Nate hasn't shown up yet. As I begin to turn and look for him
          I hear the tell tale laughs of a person about to aboslutely pummel
          their buddy in snow. The aftermath of this image was ugly. We haven't
          spoken in years. While I sit here typing this article in my 70 degree
          house I am still pulling crystals of snow from every crevice of my
          corpse. Never again.
