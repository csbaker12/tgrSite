# tgrSite
Clone of Teton Gravity Research's website
This project uses React.js, MongoDB, Express.js, and Node.js primarily. 
I encourage you to peruse the site at http://tgrclone.herokuapp.com/ 
You can sign up for an account (use a real email it will send an email to validate your account)
If you would like to get administrative access to see how articles and threads have full CRUD functionality let me know.
This site does not have every single functionality it could but I was sure to demonstrate that I am capable of giving it every thing it
might need to go to production.
